* script_expectation.py: a simple test for the martingale property.
* script_call_option.py: a call option on one asset following a Merton jump diffusion.
* script_basket_option.py: a basket call on 100 assets each following a Merton jump diffusion.
* script_call_option_CGMY.py: an example in dimension one with infinite activity.
